# Small Tart Business Webapp 
A custom e-commerce webapp built for a small tart business owner, consisting of customer facing shopping features and admin tools for adding new tarts to sell and managing tart orders. (My first freelance software development project)
## Description 
This webapp is being developed as a solution for a client looking to start a small tart business and would like to have complete creative control over the frontend design and the database structure (which is not possible when using a template based ecommerce platform). This webapp allows the business owner to add new tarts, set their prices, size, flavour, and manage customer orders through their admin access. Customers can view tarts, add tarts to their cart and purchase them.

## Tools and Frameworks
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Backend: Node.js/express
- Frontend: react/vite

## How to run it
### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 14
